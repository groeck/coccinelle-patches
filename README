The coccinelle semantic patches in this repository are expected to be applied
to the Linux kernel.

The scripts need to be run from the Linux source directory. In general, there
is one or more 'make' script in a subdirectory, as well as one or more commit
script. For example, to run the scripts for the watchdog subsystem, run

sh <gitroot>/watchdog/make.sh
sh <gitroot>/watchdog/do-commit.sh

Please note that a recent version of coccinelle (sha 45ef175b2e45 or later)
is required to run the scripts. Coccinelle is available from
git@github.com:coccinelle/coccinelle.git.

As always, make sure that the result compiles and is correct.

The scripts can easily be expanded to cover additional subsystems.
To do so, copy the make and commit scripts from an existing directory
to a new subdirectory, and make adjustments as necessary. In many cases,
the existing make scripts will just run, but should be updated to add
exclusions and subsystem specific details. Commit scripts need to be updated
to reflect subsystem specific headers and other information asked for by the
subsystem maintainer. For example, running input/make-base.sh on drivers/gpio
yields (mostly sensible) changes in more than 50 files.

The semantic patches were developed with substantial support from Julia Lawall.
Without her help, none of this would have been possible.
