Run in Linux source directory with:

make coccicheck COCCI=../coccinelle-patches/acpi/acpi.cocci \
	SPFLAGS="--linux-spacing" MODE=patch M=<dir>

to get a set of patches, or

make coccicheck COCCI=../coccinelle-patches/acpi/acpi.cocci \
	SPFLAGS="--linux-spacing" MODE=report M=<dir>

to get a report.

You'll need to update csv_source_dir in acpi.cocci to point to the
.csv file directory.

Known problems:
- __maybe_unused is added even if the data structure is protected
  with #ifdef CONFIG_ACPI.
- If code is removed entirely, #ifdef around it is left in place,
  which may result in empty #ifdef/#endif code.
- When an ACPI table is removed, no attempt is made to check
  if the table is referenced outside the .acpi_match_table
  assignment. This likely results in excessive removals.
  [ It is an open question if the code accessing the removed table
    should be removed as well, or if the table should be left alone.
  ]
- ACPI tables are either removed entirely or not at all.
  Code to remove individual bad ACPI match table entries is MIA.
