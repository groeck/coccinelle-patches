Run in Linux source directory with:

make coccicheck COCCI=../coccinelle-patches/acpi/acpi.cocci \
	SPFLAGS="--linux-spacing" MODE=patch M=<dir>

to get a set of patches, or

make coccicheck COCCI=../coccinelle-patches/acpi/acpi.cocci \
	SPFLAGS="--linux-spacing" MODE=report M=<dir>

to get a report.

You'll likely need to update csv_source_dir in acpi.cocci.

Known problems:
- __maybe_unused is added even if the data structure is protected
  with #ifdef CONFIG_ACPI.
- ACPI tables are either removed entirely or not at all.
  Code to remove individual bad ACPI match table entries is MIA.
